# DvCargoMod

Allows more cargos to be loaded into more different cars.

Currently, it allows:

- All tanker car loads in all other tankers
- Containerized fluids and gases (e.g. CryoOxygen, Argon) in takers
- Certain flatcar loads (e.g. Boards, SteelRolls) in box cars

If you know how to use the Unity Editor and how to make prefabs,
feel free to make a pull request!
If I get around to it,
prefabs will be needed for flatcars, gondolas, and hoppers
to represet the visible cargo.
